# CodelistGenerator

## Introduction
CodelistGenerator is used to create a candidate set of codes for helping to define patient cohorts in data mapped to the OMOP common data model. A little like the process for a systematic review, the idea is that for a specified search strategy, CodelistGenerator will identify a set of concepts that may be relevant, with these then being screened to remove any irrelevant codes.

## Installation
You can install the development version of CodelistGenerator like so:
``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("darwin-eu/CodelistGenerator")
```

## Example usage
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(CDMConnector)
library(CodelistGenerator)
library(kableExtra)
```

In this example we'll use the Eunomia dataset (which only contains a subset of the OMOP CDM vocabularies)
```{r}
db <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), dbdir = eunomia_dir())
cdm <- cdm_from_con(db, cdm_schema = "main")
```

Although we can run the search using vocabulary tables in the database or loaded into R, the fastest approach is using arrow. So let's create a new cdm reference using arrow (in this example saved to the temp directory, but in practice you could of course save files elsewhere for reuse).

```{r}
# save cdm vocabulary tables to temp directory
dOut<-here::here(tempdir(), "db_vocab")
dir.create(dOut)
CDMConnector::stow(cdm, dOut)
# new cdm reference using arrow
cdm_arrow <- CDMConnector::cdm_from_files(path = dOut, 
                                          as_data_frame = FALSE)
```

Every code list is specific to a version of the OMOP CDM vocabularies, so we can first check the version for Eunomia.
```{r}
getVocabVersion(cdm = cdm_arrow)
```

We can then search for asthma like so
```{r}
asthma_codes1 <- getCandidateCodes(
  cdm = cdm_arrow,
  keywords = "asthma",
  domains = "Condition"
) 
asthma_codes1 %>% 
  glimpse()
```

Perhaps we want to exclude certain concepts as part of the search strategy, in which case this can be added like so
```{r}
asthma_codes2 <- getCandidateCodes(
  cdm = cdm_arrow,
  keywords = "asthma",
  exclude = "childhood",
  domains = "Condition"
) 
asthma_codes2 %>% 
  glimpse()
```

We can compare these two code lists like so
```{r}
compareCodelists(asthma_codes1, asthma_codes2)
```

We can then also see non-standard codes these are mapped from, for example here we can see the non-standard ICD10 code that maps to a standard snomed code for gastrointestinal hemorrhage returned by our search
```{r}
Gastrointestinal_hemorrhage <- getCandidateCodes(
  cdm = cdm_arrow,
  keywords = "Gastrointestinal hemorrhage",
  domains = "Condition"
)
Gastrointestinal_hemorrhage %>% 
  glimpse()
```

```{r}
getMappings(
  cdm = cdm_arrow,
  candidateCodelist = Gastrointestinal_hemorrhage,
  nonStandardVocabularies = "ICD10CM"
) %>% 
  glimpse()

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DBI::dbDisconnect(db)
```
