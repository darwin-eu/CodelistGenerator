## Installation
You can install CodelistGenerator from CRAN
``` r
install.packages("CodelistGenerator")
```
Or you can also install the development version of CodelistGenerator
``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("darwin-eu/CodelistGenerator")
```

## Example usage
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(CDMConnector)
library(CodelistGenerator)
```

For this example we'll use the Eunomia dataset (which only contains a subset of the OMOP CDM vocabularies)
```{r}
requireEunomia()
db <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), dbdir = eunomiaDir())
cdm <- cdmFromCon(db, 
                  cdmSchema = "main", 
                  writeSchema = "main", 
                  writePrefix = "cg_")
```

## Exploring the OMOP CDM Vocabulary tables
OMOP CDM vocabularies are frequently updated, and we can identify the version of the vocabulary of our Eunomia data
```{r}
getVocabVersion(cdm = cdm)
```

## Vocabulary based codelists using CodelistGenerator
CodelistGenerator provides functions to extract code lists based on vocabulary hierarchies. One example is `getDrugIngredientCodes, which we can use, for example, to get the concept IDs used to represent aspirin and diclofenac. 
```{r}
ing <- getDrugIngredientCodes(cdm = cdm, 
                       name = c("aspirin", "diclofenac"),
                       nameStyle = "{concept_name}")
ing
ing$aspirin
ing$diclofenac
```

## Systematic search using CodelistGenerator
CodelistGenerator can also support systematic searches of the vocabulary tables to support codelist development. A little like the process for a systematic review, the idea is that for a specified search strategy, CodelistGenerator will identify a set of concepts that may be relevant, with these then being screened to remove any irrelevant codes by clinical experts.

We can do a simple search for asthma
```{r}
asthma_codes1 <- getCandidateCodes(
  cdm = cdm,
  keywords = "asthma",
  domains = "Condition"
) 
asthma_codes1 |> 
  glimpse()
```

But perhaps we want to exclude certain concepts as part of the search strategy, in this case we can add these like so
```{r}
asthma_codes2 <- getCandidateCodes(
  cdm = cdm,
  keywords = "asthma",
  exclude = "childhood",
  domains = "Condition"
) 
asthma_codes2 |> 
  glimpse()
```


## Summarising code use

As well as functions for finding codes, we also have functions to summarise their use. Here for

```{r}
library(flextable)
asthma_code_use <- summariseCodeUse(list("asthma" = asthma_codes1$concept_id),
  cdm = cdm
)
tableCodeUse(asthma_code_use, type = "flextable")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
DBI::dbDisconnect(db)
```
