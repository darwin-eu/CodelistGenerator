<p>For this example we are going to generate a candidate codelist for
dementia, only looking for codes in the condition domain. Let’s first
load some libraries</p>

</h2>
<p>CodelistGenerator works with a <code>cdm_reference</code> to the
vocabularies tables of the OMOP CDM using the CDMConnector package. This
<code>cdm_reference</code> could be to the tables in a database, using
an arrow_table, or loaded into R. CodelistGenerator will generally work
fastest with an arrow_table so let’s first set that up.</p>
