<p>For this vignette we are going to create codelists for identifying a colonoscopy. For this example we are going to generate a candidate codelists looking for codes in either the procedure, observation, or measurement domain. Note that the vocabulary we´re using doesn’t include CPT4 codes or OPCS4.</p>
